Welcome to project Asuna.

## Live Demo: https://aigirl.repl.co
*(voice unavailable)*


# Description:
* **This is not a ChatGPT or full blown all knowing AI**
* This is an English only, pattern based chat bot (for now)
* Currently using regular expressions to catch and reply specific patterns of messaged and collecting inputs and unknown inputs to train in future
* Once, With sufficient data and resources, we will perform AI training
* If you have any idea or want to provide IO datas, please file an Issue or Pull Request
* Documentation will be created soon for ease of group development.
* Currently this is an one man project and my 1st language is not English, Using 1000 years of knowledge from animes and movies to enreach the chat input response.
* So please don't expect much but I hope I'll be able to provide great performance with it.

* **Please have patience** Maintaining completely new (self made) server, UI and back end is not easy task (for me). Then again adding IO based patterns, sequencing them takes time.


* My/Our main goal is to create a Multi platform accessable voice assistant.

* our additional plan is to create their animated avatar and make it available online (via Browsers)

# How To Run:

* To Launch the server run the [RUN_ME.py](/RUN_ME.py) file
  ```
  python RUN_ME.py
  ```
* Demo video coming soon...


# Requirement:
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Works on Android Pydroid 3 ðŸ˜„ too (most develoment is done using this)


# Common IO: (similar inputs may/will work too)
* Basic `hiiii`, `hello`
* `What's your/my name` / `how're u`
* `Whats the time` / `tell time`
* <ins>**Static Q/A**</ins>, like `whats newtons 3rd law` / `whos the president of canada` / `whats root(69+420)`
* `Whats the latest news` / `news highlights`
* `Tell me about yourself` / `... your hobby/favorite game/anime`
* `Love ya`
* `Repeat after me` -> will reply whatever you say next. Say `stop/stop repeating` to stop
* `change dress` to change costumes and `change room` to switch background 
* **Many more (forgot mostly) and many more coming soon**


# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINE:
* Make changes on whatever you feel like
* Place some good comments (so that an intermediate python programmer can understand)
* Make a PR and try to explain what you have changed and if theres any issue.
* Keep in mind if you are interested :
  * pyrobox.py is the server main file (like django or flask)
  * App_server.py is the file that handles client-host request responses.
  * Chat_raw2.py is the tool that actually handles what msg will do what and reply what (can be used as standalone in CLI mode for development mode, will use test account)
* Don't worry about marge-issue, I'll update the code
* Most importantly AS A MOBILE CODER, I USUALLY DON'T FOLLOW ANY CODE STYLE GUIDELINE (or pep8), SO PLEASE DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT TOO MUCH. (I'll try to follow it in future)
