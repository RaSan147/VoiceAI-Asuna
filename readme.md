Welcome to project Asuna.
# Description:
* **This is not a ChatGPT or full blown all knowing AI**
* This is an English only pattern based chat bot (for now)
* Currently using regular expressions to catch and reply specific patterns of messaged and collecting inputs and unknown inputs to train in future
* Once, With sufficient data and resources, we will perform AI training
* If you have any idea or want to provide IO datas, please file an Issue or Pull Request
* Documentation will be created soon for ease of group development.
* Currently this is an one man project and my 1st language is not English, Using 1000 years of knowledge from animes and movies to enreach the chat input response.
* So please don't expect much but I hope I'll be able to provide great performance with it.

* My/Our main goal is to create a Multi platform accessable voice assistant.

* our additional plan is to create their animated avatar and make it available online (via Browsers)
