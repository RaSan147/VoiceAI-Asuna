SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE

4

Displays a window in its most recent size and position. This value is similar to SW_SHOWNORMAL, except that the window is not activated.



SW_SHOWNORMAL

1

Activates and displays a window. If the window is minimized or maximized, the system restores it to its original size and position. An application should specify this flag when displaying the window for the first time.
